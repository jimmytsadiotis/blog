# Automate License Compliance Across GitHub

Managing license compliance across multiple repositories can be overwhelming. Manual checks are time-consuming and prone to errors. A better approach is automation.

## The Problem

Tracking license compliance manually is inefficient and risky. Organizations need a scalable way to enforce compliance.

## The Solution

Use GitHub Rulesets and FOSSA to automatically scan dependencies and block non-compliant pull requests.

### Step 1: Set Up FOSSA Workflow

Create a repository for workflows and add the FOSSA scanning workflow.

```yaml
name: FOSSA

on:
  pull_request: {}
  workflow_dispatch: {}

jobs:
  fossa:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install FOSSA
        run: |
          curl -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fossas/fossa-cli/master/install-latest.sh | bash
      - name: Set API Key
        env:
          FOSSA_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.FOSSA_API_KEY }}
        run: echo "FOSSA_API_KEY=${FOSSA_API_KEY}" >> $GITHUB_ENV
      - name: Run FOSSA Analysis
        run: fossa analyze
      - name: Run FOSSA Test
        run: fossa test
```

### Step 2: Configure GitHub Rulesets

1. Navigate to Organization Settings > Repository Rulesets.
2. Create a new ruleset targeting relevant repositories.
3. Add the FOSSA workflow as a required check.

### Step 3: Define FOSSA Policies

Set license compliance rules in FOSSA and apply them to your projects.

### Step 4: Test & Verify

1. Create a pull request.
2. Ensure the FOSSA scan runs and blocks non-compliant changes.
