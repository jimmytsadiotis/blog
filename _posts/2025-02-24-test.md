# Stop License Nightmares: Automate Compliance Across Your GitHub Organization

Imagine this: you're scaling rapidly, your team's pushing code to hundreds of repositories, and suddenly, you're hit with a legal notice about unlicensed dependencies. Sound familiar?

We've all been there. Manually checking licenses across a vast codebase is a recipe for disaster. But what if you could automate it all, ensuring every dependency meets your organization's standards?

That's exactly what we're going to dive into. We'll explore how to leverage the power of **GitHub Repository Rulesets** and **FOSSA** to build a centralized, scalable license compliance system.

## The Challenge: Scaling Compliance Without Scaling Headaches

The old way? Custom scripts in every repository. Tedious, error-prone, and a maintenance nightmare. We needed a solution that:

* **Centralized Control:** Manage compliance from a single point.
* **Automation:** Eliminate manual license checks.
* **Scalability:** Work seamlessly across hundreds of repositories.
* **CI/CD Integration:** Fail builds on non-compliant licenses.

## The Solution: GitHub Rulesets + FOSSA

We're going to build a system that automatically scans dependencies for unwanted licenses, configured at the GitHub organization level, and fails pull requests that don't meet our requirements.

### Step 1: Building the Centralized FOSSA Workflow

We'll start by creating a dedicated repository, `required-workflows`, to house our FOSSA scanning workflow.

```yaml
name: FOSSA

on:
  pull_request: {}
  workflow_dispatch: {}
  merge_group:
    types: [checks_requested]

jobs:
  fossa:
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04 # or self-hosted
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install FOSSA
        run: |
          curl -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fossas/fossa-cli/master/install-latest.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fossas/fossa-cli/master/install-latest.sh) | bash
      - name: Set FOSSA API Key
        env:
          FOSSA_API_KEY: <span class="math-inline">\{\{ secrets\.FOSSA\_API\_KEY \}\}
run\: echo "FOSSA\_API\_KEY\=</span>{FOSSA_API_KEY}" >> $GITHUB_ENV
      - name: Run FOSSA Analysis
        run: fossa analyze
      - name: Run FOSSA Test
        run: fossa test
        # Remove continue-on-error: true to fail pipeline on violations
```
Note: For self-hosted runners and to initially prevent pipeline failures, you can use the following alternative workflow configuration:

```yaml
name: FOSSA

on:
  pull_request: {}
  workflow_dispatch: {}
  merge_group:
    types: [checks_requested]

jobs:
  fossa:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install FOSSA
        run: |
          mkdir -p /home/github-runner/bin
          curl -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fossas/fossa-cli/master/install-latest.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fossas/fossa-cli/master/install-latest.sh) | bash -s -- -b /home/github-runner/bin
          ls -l /home/github-runner/bin
          chmod +x /home/github-runner/bin/fossa
      - name: Add FOSSA to PATH
        run: echo "/home/github-runner/bin" >> $GITHUB_PATH
      - name: Set FOSSA API Key
        env:
          FOSSA_API_KEY: <span class="math-inline">\{\{ secrets\.FOSSA\_API\_KEY \}\}
run\: echo "FOSSA\_API\_KEY\=</span>{FOSSA_API_KEY}" >> $GITHUB_ENV
      - name: Run FOSSA Analysis
        run: fossa analyze
      - name: Run FOSSA Test
        run: fossa test
        continue-on-error: true
```

## Step 2: Granting Access and Setting Secrets

We'll need to grant workflow access to our organization and configure the `FOSSA_API_KEY` as an organization secret.

* **Workflow Access:** `Settings > Actions > General` in the `required-workflows` repository.

    ![Workflow Access Settings](path/to/workflow-access-image.png)

* **Organization Secret:** `Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions` in your GitHub organization.

    ![Organization Secret Settings](path/to/organization-secret-image.png)

## Step 3: Implementing GitHub Repository Rulesets

This is where the magic happens. We'll create a ruleset that automatically applies the FOSSA workflow to all targeted repositories.

* Navigate to your organization's settings and create a new repository ruleset.
* Configure the ruleset to target the desired repositories and branches.
* Add a required workflow, selecting the FOSSA workflow from `required-workflows`.

    ![Repository Ruleset Settings](path/to/repository-ruleset-image.png)

## Step 4: Configuring FOSSA Policies

We'll define our license compliance policies in FOSSA and ensure they're applied correctly.

* **Issue Settings:** Configure FOSSA to match your compliance requirements.

    ![Issue Settings](path/to/issue-settings-image.png)

* **License Policies:** Create and set the default policy to reflect your organization's rules.

    ![License Policies](path/to/license-policies-image.png)

* **Propagate Settings:** Apply the policies across your projects.

    ![Propagate Settings](path/to/propagate-settings-image.png)

## Step 5: Testing and Verification

Finally, we'll create a pull request in a targeted repository to verify the workflow.

* Create a pull request and check the workflow status.

    ![Workflow Status](path/to/workflow-status-image.png)

* Review the FOSSA scan results.

    ![FOSSA Scan Results](path/to/fossa-scan-results-image.png)

**Pro Tip:** Remove `continue-on-error: true` from the workflow to fail pull requests on license violations.

## Why This Matters

By implementing this system, you'll:

* **Reduce Legal Risk:** Ensure compliance with open source licenses.
* **Improve Efficiency:** Eliminate manual license checks.
* **Enhance Security:** Prevent the introduction of vulnerable or malicious dependencies.
* **Scale Confidently:** Manage compliance as your organization grows.

This approach transforms license compliance from a daunting task into a seamless, automated process. Say goodbye to license nightmares and hello to peace of mind.
